## Project Description
Ride-Care is an app for people who use the LA Metro public transportation system. It is designed to help riders get off the bus at the right time. Currently, bus public address systems and drivers are inconsistent in announcing bus stops. It is easy for a rider to miss his/her stop, and missing a stop can have serious consequences. 

Ride-Care is designed to alert a rider of approaching bus stop. The rider uses a smartphone to enter his/her LA Metro route and destination stop. The app detects the rider's location and traces his/her location while riding the bus. The rider also indicated the time (in minutes) needed prior to being notified of an impending stop. 

## Project Specification

The project will utilize information from LA Metro and Google as well as algorithms for time and geographical distance.

## APIs to be Used

A number of APIs will be utilized in this project, including LA Metro, Google Maps, and Firebase. 

JavaScript packages used include moment.js and reveal.js for the presentation.
